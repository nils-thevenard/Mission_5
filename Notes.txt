We should be able to run everything directly from the client folder so you just need to npm install both directorys 
And from then on you can just work out of the client folder: 

cd client
npm run both

No need to manually seed the database. When you run the client you should see a button that will automatically seed the database for you, and this will stay seeded on your local machine even if you close docker. But docker/local database are seperate.

template.json is a unique list of genuine propertys. propertyData uses the unique data from the templates to create multiple properties in each area so they appear more populated in search results.

Here are some custom commands you can run from the client:

npm run both = runs both servers using the below commands at the same time:
                        - npm run server = run the backend server from within the client folder
                        - npm run dev = standard Vite development server

npm run prettier-<your_name> = will only run prettier on files in your directory.
npm run prettier-global = will apply prettier globally. This will mess with other peoples files.
